this is for learning purpose, 

why utils file...

==>  we have some logic in component which are specific for just it, so we create a utils.js and we'll write logic in util and export it from this file to our desired component 


why constant file...

if we have some defined constant in our component..
such as  

const DEFAULT_AGE = 18; 

then such kind of constant we'll write in this file
